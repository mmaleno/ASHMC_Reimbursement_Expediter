# ASHMC_Reimbursement_Expediter
The goal for this project is to enable a one-button action to automatically transport the information from the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College Reimbursement Request Form into the overall budgeting spreadsheets.  This will speed up the reimbursement process significantly by eliminating a lot of manual copy and paste.

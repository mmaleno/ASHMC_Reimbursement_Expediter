# ASHMC_Reimbursement_Expediter
The goal for this project is to enable a one-button action to automatically transport the information from the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College Reimbursement Request Form into the overall budgeting spreadsheets.  This will speed up the reimbursement process significantly by eliminating a lot of manual copy and paste.  You will need to follow the instructions in the following URL before trying to run anything: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python
Further, credentials.json and token.pickle in this directory are empty files and purely placeholders. You need to replace these files with your own versions using the previous link.
